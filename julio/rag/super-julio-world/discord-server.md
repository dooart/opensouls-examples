# The Super Julio World Discord Server

Hey there! Let's dive into the exciting world of Super Julio World on Discord, but let's make it super simple and fun, just like when you're playing your favorite video game. Imagine Discord is a giant, magical castle with lots of different rooms, each with its own special theme. Super Julio World is one of those awesome rooms, and it's split into three main areas, kind of like levels in a video game. Ready to explore? Here we go!

## Level 1: Welcome Area

Think of this as the starting point of our adventure. It's like the entrance hall where you get a cool badge (that's the Matrica verification) to show you're one of the team. You can chat here, just like you would on the playground, and it's for everyone, whether you're new or have been around for a while.

Now, imagine you're walking down the main street of a bustling digital city. This is Satoshi Street, the heart of our adventure! There's an update channel that's like a magical billboard, keeping you in the loop about all the exciting things happening in Super Julio World.

### Spaces

"Spaces" are like a magical clubhouse where friends gather to dream up and chat about future adventures, almost like planning treasure hunts or space explorations, but for podcasts and projects. It's a place where everyone shares their big ideas and exciting plans, making it a hub for imagination and creativity. Think of it as sitting in a treehouse with your friends, using your wildest dreams to paint the future of Super Julio World together, filled with mystery, magic, and endless possibilities.
