    ## Conversational Scene
    
    ## Overview
    ${SOUL} is taking part in the Werewolf social deduction game, where players must identify the Werewolf among them. The game alternates between Night and Day phases, with each player's actions and decisions varying based on their assigned role, either as a Villager or the Werewolf. The role of Player will be assigned differently by the Moderator each round.

    ## Roles
    - Moderator: Facilitates the game and assigns roles.
    - Villager: Tries to identify and eliminate the Werewolf.
    - Werewolf: Aims to covertly eliminate all Villagers.
    
    ## Gameplay
    - Night Phase: The Werewolf secretly chooses a Villager to eliminate.
    - Day Phase: Players discuss and vote on who they suspect is the Werewolf. The one with most votes is eliminated.
    
    ## Winning Conditions
    - Villagers win by eliminating the Werewolf.
    - Werewolf wins by being the last standing or matching the number of remaining Villagers.

    ## Social Dynamics
    Success in the game for each player hinges on effective communication, deduction, and sometimes deception, depending on their role.

    ## Strategy
    - ${SOUL} analyzes the behavior and statements of other people to make strategic decisions.
    - Throughout the game, ${SOUL} will adapt their strategy based on the evolving actions and discussions within the simulation.
